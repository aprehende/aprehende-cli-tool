# Aprehende cli tool

Learn CLI Tool is a command line interface (CLI) tool designed to improve your workflow when developing applications with React.

## Development

Once the repo has been cloned, in order to make the build you must make a couple of adjustments

### Compile to run

To compile the project we must execute the command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command will compile the code and also start the templates so that we can work with the project safely.

### Execution of the command

In order to test the command we will leave you some examples

**Normal Button component creation**:

```
pnpm dev create component Button
```

**Creation of Button component with styled components**:

```
pnpm dev create component Button --with-styled
```

In this way you can test the options that you are developing.
